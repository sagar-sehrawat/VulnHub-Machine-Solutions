# Clover Writeup

## Initial Recon

Started with a Rustscan and found FTP, SSH, and HTTP services running as normal.

Logged into FTP as `anonymous` and found 3 files, but none of them were useful.

Started some directory busting and found lots of content to work with, including a `phpmyadmin` panelâ€”perhaps we need to perform SQL injection there. There was also a `robots.txt` file but nothing of interest. Additionally, I found a webpage, but nothing was discovered during my enumeration.

In the source code of a page, I saw a comment mentioning a CMS under construction: ColdFusion. This was useful, and after further enumeration, I found its directory `CFIDE`, leading to a login page. The comment also mentioned, "we forgot to disable the login page," which seemed like a hint.

I tried some basic SQL injection, and it worked! I logged in but found nothing significant. There was nothing interesting in the cookies either.

I then captured the login request through Burp Suite and used SQLmap with the static POST request. After some effort, I was able to retrieve the database named `clover`.

After further digging, I found the tables and eventually retrieved user credentials.

## Cracking the Hash

I tried cracking the hash using John and Hashcat but couldn't crack it. After identifying the hash using `hash-identifier`, I discovered it was an MD5 hash for the user `asta`. Using an online tool, I cracked the hash and logged in as `asta`.

## Privilege Escalation

After doing basic enumeration, I found another user, `sword`. I tried importing LinPEAS for automatic enumeration, but since neither curl nor wget was available, I transferred the script using PHP and launched it. I found part of `sword`'s password, but it was incomplete.

Using Python automation for permutations, I generated a wordlist. You can also use Crunch to do this and crack the `sword` password with Hydra. After successfully logging in as `sword` and performing further enumeration with LinPEAS, I found an SUID binary.

The binary was named `daemon`. Initially, I suspected cron jobs were involved, so I used pspy to monitor them, but found nothing.

Next, I focused on the `daemon` binary. I transferred it to my local machine and performed reverse engineering. After some research, I figured out the command I needed to use, which gave me a root shell.
